# ðŸ¤– Model Context Protocol (MCP) Examples

This repository contains modular MCP agent servers built using the [Model Context Protocol TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).  
Each subdirectory in `src/` is a self-contained MCP server with tools and prompts (e.g., code analysis, summarization, etc.).

> âœ¨ The root `src/index.ts` dynamically registers and launches all individual servers.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts         # Main launcher to register all MCP servers
â”œâ”€â”€ code-analysis/   # Analyzes local code repositories
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools.ts     # Tool implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.ts    # Registers tools & prompts with MCP
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.ts     # Helper functions (file reading, structure)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prompt.ts    # Prompt handler definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md    # Module-specific usage docs
...
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. (Optional) Set up local `.env`

```bash
echo "PORT=3000" > .env
```

### 3. Start the MCP server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> The server will run at:
> `http://localhost:3000/mcp`

---

## ðŸ§ª Debugging / Manual Testing

You can test the server using **MCP Inspector**, a UI debugger for MCP-based servers.

### Start the MCP Inspector (in another terminal)

```bash
npm run debug
```

Then open:
ðŸ‘‰ `http://127.0.0.1:6274`
and connect to `http://localhost:3000/mcp` using **Streamable HTTP**.
